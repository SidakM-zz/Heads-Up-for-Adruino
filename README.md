Game Summary:
The game will require a group of 2 to 4 people to
take turns holding the board in front of their foreheads with the LCD screen facing outwards.
Once a round begins a word will appear on the LCD screen and everyone will shout clues to the
current player. Once the player correctly guesses the word he/she can tilt and move the device
downwards to proceed to the next word. At any time, the player may also tilt the board to the left or right to
skip the current word. A playerâ€™s score will be calculated based upon the words he/she was
correctly able to guess within 60 seconds. The player with the highest score will win the game.
